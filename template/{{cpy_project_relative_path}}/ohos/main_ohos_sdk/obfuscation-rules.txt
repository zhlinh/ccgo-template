# Define project specific obfuscation rules here.
# You can include the obfuscation configuration files in the current module's build-profile.json5.
#
# For more details, see
#   https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/source-obfuscation-V5

# Obfuscation options:
# -disable-obfuscation: disable all obfuscations
# -enable-property-obfuscation: obfuscate the property names
# -enable-toplevel-obfuscation: obfuscate the names in the global scope
# -enable-filename-obfuscation: obfuscate the file names
# -enable-export-obfuscation: obfuscate the export names
# -compact: remove unnecessary blank spaces and all line feeds
# -remove-log: remove all console.* statements
# -print-namecache: print the name cache that contains the mapping from the old names to new names
# -apply-namecache: reuse the given cache file

# Keep options:
# -keep-property-name: specifies property names that you want to keep
# -keep-global-name: specifies names that you want to keep in the global scope
# -keep-dts: keep names exported from .d.ets declaration files
# -keep: keep all names in specified path (files or directories)

# Disable obfuscation for HAR package
# Reason: All exports in HAR are public APIs that must remain accessible to consumers.
# The native C++ library (.so) is already compiled binary, obfuscating ArkTS layer provides little value.

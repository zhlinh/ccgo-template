# Consumer obfuscation rules for HAR package
# These rules are automatically applied to modules that depend on this HAR.
#
# When consumer modules enable obfuscation, these rules ensure that
# the HAR's exported APIs remain accessible.
#
# For more details, see
#   https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/source-obfuscation-V5

# Keep all exports from declaration file
# Note: Create Index.d.ets with your exported types if needed
-keep-dts
./Index.d.ets
